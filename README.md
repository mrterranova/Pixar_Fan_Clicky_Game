# Pixar Fan Clicky Game

This is a ReactJS game to understand the basic principles of react.js. This is a simple game where react.js allows user to see real-time progress with fully rendered pages. The famous Pixar characters were borrowed. Note: This app was created entirely for educational purposes with no money being made from the app.

## Game Instructions

  When you open the page, it will automatically start you on "easy" level. You can upgrade your game play to "Normal" or "Challenge" each level means more character cards on the page.
  
  - easy has 12 characters
  - normal has 18 characters
  - challenge has 32 characters
  
  Pick the level that best suits you!
  
  You then click on a character to start the game. Make sure that you never click a character twice or you will lose and have to start over. Your score is recorded in the top right corner along with the Top Score. The top score changes in realtime if you beat the previous top score. There is no back-end attached to this project, so your top score is only temporarily saved.
